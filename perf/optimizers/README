节选自man gcc
TL;DR: 可以用gcc -c -Q -O3 --help=optimizers来查看具体使用了什么优化选项


           If the -Q option appears on the command line before the
           --help= option, then the descriptive text displayed by
           --help= is changed.  Instead of describing the displayed
           options, an indication is given as to whether the option is
           enabled, disabled or set to a specific value (assuming that
           the compiler knows this at the point where the --help= option
           is used).

           Here is a truncated example from the ARM port of gcc:

                     % gcc -Q -mabi=2 --help=target -c
                     The following options are target specific:
                     -mabi=                                2
                     -mabort-on-noreturn                   [disabled]
                     -mapcs                                [disabled]

           The output is sensitive to the effects of previous command-
           line options, so for example it is possible to find out which
           optimizations are enabled at -O2 by using:

                   -Q -O2 --help=optimizers

           Alternatively you can discover which binary optimizations are
           enabled by -O3 by using:

                   gcc -c -Q -O3 --help=optimizers > /tmp/O3-opts
                   gcc -c -Q -O2 --help=optimizers > /tmp/O2-opts
                   diff /tmp/O2-opts /tmp/O3-opts | grep enabled
